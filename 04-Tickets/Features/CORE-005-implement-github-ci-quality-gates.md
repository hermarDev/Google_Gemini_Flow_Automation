# CORE-005 — Implement GitHub CI quality gates

> [!info] Ticket context
> **Sprint:** [[Sprint-01|Sprint-01]] · **Epic:** [[EPIC-002|EPIC-002]] · **Status:** `backlog` · **Priority:** `medium`

## User outcome and scope

Configure install, lint, typecheck, tests, build and dependency audit steps for PRs.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **Deliverable:** Configure install, lint, typecheck, tests, build and dependency audit steps for PRs.
- [ ] **Verification:** A deliberately broken fixture blocks merge; successful fixture passes.
- [ ] **Failure safety:** Missing selector, unavailable model, signed-out account, lost tab or unknown submission state must stop safely and show a truthful status.
- [ ] **Evidence:** Automated unit/integration fixture (offline) plus manual browser proof where a real site interaction is required.
- [ ] **Traceability:** Record changed files, relevant test command/results, a commit/PR reference (if implemented), and remaining limitations.

## Dependencies

[[CORE-003-build-vite-multi-entry-extension-pipeline|CORE-003]], [[CORE-004-configure-formatting-static-analysis-and-typescript-strict|CORE-004]]

## Suggested implementation steps

1. Review dependency tickets, [[MASTER-PLAN]], and relevant architecture/security guidelines; confirm the intended interface and constraints.
2. Write or update a failing test/fixture or a research verification checklist for this specific behavior.
3. Implement only this ticket's scoped change; do not expand into unrelated backlog tasks.
4. Execute positive, negative, and interruption tests; update documentation and reproducible evidence.
5. Request review, address findings and update ticket properties only after Definition of Done is satisfied.

## Verification notes

**Specific verification:** A deliberately broken fixture blocks merge; successful fixture passes.

**Test context:** Record browser version and Google UI/model availability for site-dependent tests. Do not consume paid credits without explicit approved test budget.
